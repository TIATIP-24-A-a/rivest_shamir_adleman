# RSA Implementation Roadmap

## 1. Big Integer Math Layer
- [ ] BigInt class (core operations)
- [ ] Modular arithmetic operations
- [ ] Constant-time operations

## 2. Prime Numbers
- [ ] Primality testing
- [ ] Prime generation
- [ ] Prime verification

## 3. Core RSA Math
- [ ] Key generation
- [ ] Basic encryption/decryption
- [ ] CRT implementation
- [ ] Montgomery multiplication

## 4. Security Features
- [ ] Padding scheme
- [ ] Blinding countermeasures
- [ ] Side-channel protections

## 5. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for operations
- [ ] Known-answer tests
- [ ] Security validation
